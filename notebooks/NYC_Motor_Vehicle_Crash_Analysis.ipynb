    "## **Project Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project outlines the motor vehicle (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycle) accident data in NYC, based on intersection characteristics, finding patterns within drivers, accident concentration by zip code, and commonalities among high risk areas and vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Our Goal**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to create a model to predict potential injury or fatalities based on variables given by NYPD public data. It also aims to create an interactive heat map for intersection collisions and provide a comprehensive look at where collisions are occuring in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further exploration of this model could aid insurance companies in adjusting premiums for high risk profiles and locations, provide government agencies with actionable data to improve traffic safety, and give new yorkers a compreshensive look at where accidents are occuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on doing so by analyzing historical accident data from the last 10 years, traffic patterns, and intersection structures. The predictive model will identify high risk areas and attempt to predict future accidents within a certain margin of error. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Methodology**: \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on using NYC public data in order to create this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using SQL, and more specifically Google's RDBMS BigQuery to retrieve and clean data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using R to help with statistical analysis on the cleaned dataset, as well as to create the logistical regression model for injury/fatality analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "And finally we will be using Tableau to create a heat map of high risk areas and intersections with high counts of collisions. "

    "## **Conclusions From Significant Predictors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions from Borough\n",
    "* Manhattan has the lowest probability of injury/fatality (Estimate: -1.035, p < 0.001).\n",
    "* The Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens also show lower odds, though less significantly than Manhattan.\n",
    "* Accidents in Manhattan are significantly less likely to result in injuries or fatalities compared to the baseline borough (Staten Island) which might be because of high traffic and less high speed collisions. Further research would be needed to fully explain what is causing this decrease in injuries or fatalities in the boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions from Vehicle Type\n",
    "* Motorcycles have the highest risk (Estimate: 1.95, p < 0.001), meaning motorcycle crashes are much more likely to result in injury or death. Motorcycles don't have the same protections that other motor vehicles do, which could explain why this is the case. \n",
    "* Taxis/Livery vehicles also show a higher risk (Estimate: 0.28, p = 0.01).\n",
    "* SUVs and Sedans have increased risk compared to the baseline vehicle type.\n",
    "* Other vehicles show a slight negative effect (Estimate: -0.25, p = 0.047), suggesting they are less risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions from Sex of Driver\n",
    "* Males are significantly less likely to be injured or killed in an accident (Estimate: -0.34, p < 0.001). This might warrant further research as to why this might be the case. \n",
    "* Females appear to have a higher risk of injury or fatality in accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion from Driver’s License Status\n",
    "* Licensed drivers are significantly less likely to be injured (Estimate: -0.41, p < 0.001).\n",
    "* Permit drivers shows no strong effect (p = 0.237).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion from Age\n",
    "* Age has a significant non linear effect, modeled as a parabolic function in the regression model\n",
    "* The first order polynomial has a strong negative impact (Estimate: -32.87, p < 0.001).\n",
    "* The second order term has a positive effect (Estimate: 11.85, p = 0.0003).\n",
    "* This suggests that injury risk is higher at younger and older ages, following a U-shaped relationship. This makes sense intuitively as younger drivers tend to be risker with their driving and older drivers could be more prone to injury. "

    "Overall, this analysis identified key factors influencing injury and fatality risks in NYC. The borough of the accident, type of vehicle involved, driver's sex, and license status all play a significant role in determining the likelihood of an injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the findings, Manhattan stands out as the safest borough in terms of injury rates, likely due to lower speed collisions in traffic. Motorcycles pose by far the highest risk, reinforcing the need for improved safety measures for motorcyclists. Age has a U shaped relationship with injury/fatality, showing increased risk of both younger and older drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many of these results align with intuition and observations, further research is needed to expand on the underlying reasons of some trends, such as why female drivers have higher injury rates than males or why unlicensed drivers appear less likely to be reported as injured. Future work could incorporate additional factors like time of day, brand of the vehicle, or traffic laws to refine risk assessments even further."
