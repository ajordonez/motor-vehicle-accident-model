    "## **Project Overview**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project outlines the motor vehicle (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycle) accident data in NYC, based on intersection characteristics, finding patterns within drivers, accident concentration by zip code, and commonalities among high risk areas and vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Our Goal**: \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to create a model to predict potential injury or fatalities based on variables given by NYPD public data. It also aims to create an interactive heat map for intersection collisions and provide a comprehensive look at where collisions are occuring in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further exploration of this model could aid insurance companies in adjusting premiums for high risk profiles and locations, provide government agencies with actionable data to improve traffic safety, and give new yorkers a compreshensive look at where accidents are occuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on doing so by analyzing historical accident data from the last 10 years, traffic patterns, and intersection structures. The predictive model will identify high risk areas and attempt to predict future accidents within a certain margin of error. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Methodology**: \n",
    "\n",
    "We plan on using NYC public data in order to create this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using SQL, and more specifically Google's RDBMS BigQuery to retrieve and clean data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using R to help with statistical analysis on the cleaned dataset, as well as to create the logistical regression model for injury/fatality analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "And finally we will be using Tableau to create a heat map of high risk areas and intersections with high counts of collisions. "
